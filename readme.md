- Steps to clone this repository and set up the local environment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains housing-related information, including features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and price. It serves as the basis for predicting house prices. You can download the dataset from here or access it through the project's data folder.

## Usage
## Data Exploration
- **Open the Notebook**: Start by opening the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.

- **Explore the Data**: Navigate through the notebook sections to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. This initial step is crucial to get a sense of the data you'll be working with.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values**: Follow the data preprocessing steps outlined in the notebook to handle missing values in the dataset. Ensuring data completeness is essential for accurate analysis.

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Implement one-hot encoding for categorical variables. This transforms categorical data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Gain Insights**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the dataset. EDA involves visualizations and summary statistics to help you understand data patterns, distributions, and potential relationships.

## Model Building
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the selected features. The model will learn from the data to make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics provide quantitative measures of how well the model predicts house prices.

## Results
- **Interpretation**: In the results section, interpret the findings to understand the predictive capability of the model. Provide insights into how well the model performs in predicting house prices and any implications of the analysis.


## Methodology
The project follows a structured methodology:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: This phase involves handling missing values and converting categorical variables using one-hot encoding. Ensuring data quality and format is crucial for accurate analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this step, the dataset is thoroughly analyzed through visualizations and summary statistics. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights.

3. **Feature Selection**: Feature selection is a critical part of the analysis. Relevant features are selected to be used in the predictive model. This step helps improve model efficiency and effectiveness.

4. **Linear Regression Model**: The project implements a linear regression model. This model is used to predict house prices based on the selected features. The model learns from the data and makes predictions.

The structured approach ensures that the analysis is organized and systematic, leading to meaningful insights and accurate predictions.
