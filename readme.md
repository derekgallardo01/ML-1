- Steps to clone this repository and set up the local environment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains housing-related information, including features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and price. It serves as the basis for predicting house prices. You can download the dataset from here or access it through the project's data folder.

## Usage
Data Exploration: Open the Jupyter Notebook and navigate through the sections. Start by exploring the data to understand its structure and characteristics.

Data Preprocessing: Follow the data preprocessing steps outlined in the notebook, including handling missing values and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and summary statistics are provided to assist you in understanding the data.

Model Building: Implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the selected features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Results: Interpret the results to understand the predictive capability of the model. This section provides insights into how well the model performs in predicting house prices.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured methodology:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values and converting categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
